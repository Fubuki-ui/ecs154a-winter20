Websites
--------

GitHub
~~~~~~

We will use GitHub_ as the main website for the course.
It will also contain all of the documents for the course, such as labs, lecture notes, the schedule, and the syllabus you're currently reading.

The versions of documents found on GitHub are the canonical versions of all documents.
If I make changes to those documents, they will appear first here on GitHub.
Other downloaded versions of documents may become out of date.

Canvas
~~~~~~

We will use Canvas_ for the weekly quizzes and for grade keeping.

Gradescope
~~~~~~~~~~

We will use Gradescope_ for lab submissions, as well as for returning the midterm and the final.
Gradescope's autograder will give you relatively quick feedback about your lab submissions.
For the exams, Gradescope gives you a graded PDF version of your test, along with a rubric, immediately after we're done grading.
You will receive an email from Gradescope to make your account at the start of the class.

Campuswire
~~~~~~~~~~

We will use Campuswire_ for class discussions outside of the classroom.
It will serve as the discussion board for this quarter.
If you've used Piazza before, it's very similar, though it has some additional features that I think are nice.
The TAs and I will be on Campuswire to answer questions.

It's best to ask your questions on Campuswire.
That way, all of your classmates can see the answer instead of emailing the TA or me.
Additionally, you may get a faster response from one of your classmates.

*Under construction.*

In the spirit of the above, please post questions to everyone on Campuswire, if possible.
This way, your question, and the answer to your question, can help somebody else who might have the same question.
We will change the visibility of questions posted only to instructors to everyone, if we deem it appropriate.
If your question involves code you've written, or is about a personal issue, we will leave those private.
The same applies to questions asked via direct message—we will redirect you to Campuswire if appropriate.

Other Important Information
---------------------------

Regrade Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regrade requests must be made within one week of the return of the assignment or test.

Accommodations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The exam schedule is available on the schedule_.
Per `official UC Davis policy`_, if you have an accommodation request from the `Student Disability Center`_, or have any conflicts with exam times for religious observances, you must notify me by the **fourth class, Monday, 2020-01-13**.

.. _official UC Davis policy: https://academicsenate.ucdavis.edu/bylaws-regulations/regulations#538-
.. _Student Disability Center: https://sdc.ucdavis.edu/

Student Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a student, you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation.
These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student’s ability to participate in daily activities.
UC Davis is committed to advancing the mental health and well-being of its students.
If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available.
You can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via `Student Health and Counseling Services`_.
In addition, you can learn about a variety of other resources for students at UC Davis on the `Pages tab of Canvas`_.

You can also direct message me on Campuswire_ to talk in private.

Academic Misconduct
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Academic misconduct is a serious issue.
You can find the official UC Davis policy on the `Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs`_ website.
The `Code of Academic Conduct`_ also contains more information.

As it notes on the README_ for this repository, public forks of this repository with assignment code in them abet cheating.
Any public forks with code in them will be considered academic misconduct.

The labs will be partner assignments.
Feel free to share ideas with other groups.
You may not share code or circuits, however.
If you're looking at another group's code or circuits, odds are that you've gone past simply sharing ideas.

You are expected to *cite all of the work you reference*.
Any ideas that are not specifically yours or generally known (e.g., caches hold data) should have a citation.
When in doubt, cite.

Any violations of the Code of Academic Conduct will result in reporting the violating student(s) to the Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs.
As stated in the Code of Academic Conduct:

    If academic misconduct is admitted or is determined by adjudication to have occurred, instructors may assign a grade penalty no greater than "F" for the course in question.

Labs
~~~~

You will complete five lab assignments throughout this course.
The labs can found via the links below.
All together, the labs are worth 40% of your final grade, though some labs may be weighted more than others.

*Under construction.*

For all labs, you may (and are suggested to) work with a partner.
You do not have to keep the same partner throughout the whole quarter; you can change who you work with.
I suggest using Campuswire_ to find partners.

.. _Lab 1: https://github.com/jlperona-teaching/ecs154a-winter20/blob/master/lab1/lab1.rst

Late Assignments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you turn in a lab late, you will lose points.
The percentage of points you will lose is given by the equation below.
This will give you partial points up to 48 hours after the due date.

*Under construction.*

Late quiz submissions will not be allowed.
